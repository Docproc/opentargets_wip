# Random Open Targets stuff

## random_tsv

Takes an input TSV file (see `sample.tsv`) and produces an arbitrary-sized output TSV with values picked at random from the equivalent columns in the input file.
Optionally looks up textual phenotype terms in the EFO ontology (using [opentargets/ontoma](https://github.com/opentargets/OnToma/)) and adds them to the output.

## tsv_to_json

Takes an input TSV (probably generated by `random_tsv.py`) and generates JSON output (one object per line) which should be valid according to the [opentargets/validator](https://github.com/opentargets/validator).
